# Functional Specification Document (FSD) for User Registration and Authentication

## 1. Overview

The "User Registration and Authentication" feature is a fundamental component of the payments web application, allowing users to create accounts, log in securely, and access their personalized banking information. This section outlines the specific requirements and functionalities related to user registration and authentication.

## 2. User Registration

### 2.1 Registration Process

- Users should have the option to register using their existing bank account credentials or by creating new credentials through the web application.
- If the user chooses to create new credentials, they should be prompted to provide the following information:
  - Full name
  - Email address
  - Password (with password strength validation)
- The web application should validate the user's email address for uniqueness and proper format.

### 2.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- After successful registration, the web application should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
- MFA methods may include One-Time Passwords (OTP) sent via SMS or email.
- Users must complete the MFA process before gaining access to their accounts.

## 3. User Login

### 3.1 Authentication

- Users should be able to log in using their registered email address and password.
- The web application should employ secure authentication protocols to protect against brute-force attacks and account lockouts.

### 3.2 Forgot Password

- The web application should provide a "Forgot Password" feature to allow users to reset their passwords in case they forget them.

## 4. Account Security

### 4.1 Account Lockout

- Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts.
- After a specified number of failed login attempts, the user's account should be temporarily locked to prevent unauthorized access.

### 4.2 Session Management

- The web application should manage user sessions securely and log users out automatically after a period of inactivity.
- Users should be able to manually log out from their accounts.

### 4.3 Account Recovery

- Provide a secure account recovery process in case the user loses access to their registered email address.

## 5. Compliance and Data Privacy

### 5.1 Data Storage

- All user credentials and personal information should be securely stored in an encrypted format.

### 5.2 Compliance

- The registration and authentication process must comply with relevant data protection regulations and banking industry standards.

## 6. Error Handling and Messaging

- The web application should provide clear and user-friendly error messages for unsuccessful registration or login attempts.
- The messaging system should communicate the status of verification steps (e.g., MFA, password reset) clearly to the user.

## 7. Testing Requirements

- Comprehensive testing should be conducted to ensure the security and usability of the registration and authentication features.
- Testing should include verification of MFA methods, password recovery, account lockout, and security measures.

## 8. User Interface (UI) Design

- The user interface for registration and login should be intuitive and responsive.
- Clear instructions and labels should guide users through the process.

## 9. Integration with Backend

- The web application should integrate with the bank's backend systems to authenticate user credentials and securely store user information.
